Expandable Table View
=======================

Expandable Table view is an effort to try to recreate iOS 10's Apple Maps Table view. 

This currently supports a bottom and middle transitions. When the view is presented, it is presented at the bottom.

The Tableview header has a UITapGestureRecognizer and when tapped, this view transitions to either the middle or bottom. 

It is a work in progress but its just something I spun up in an hour or so.
